Streaker 2013
=============
URL: https://github.com/ashdnazg/ld27

This is a game created for the 27th Ludum Dare competition. (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo)
The theme for the competition was 10 seconds.

You play the odd person that thinks running into football games with no clothes on is smart.

The headlines in the end screen are some rudimentary achievements system.


Controls
========
Arrows: Run.
Space: Wiggle.


Notice
======
This game does not endorse any public nudity that your local laws prohibit.
On the contrary, I suggest that when considering illegal activities you will decide to play Streaker 2013 instead.
